Accreditation of knowledge of languages
Accreditation of knowledge of languages
Description
UPF has an integrated and automated system for all formalities and procedures that require you to accredit your level of language proficiency:
Language accreditation for the call for mobility applications
Academic recognition in credits for language learning during undergraduate studies (RAC)
Incorporation of credits into a minor in plurilingualism
UPF believes that learning foreign languages is essential for undergraduate students. The University therefore aims not only to promote this form of training, but also to recognise the efforts of those students who in recent years have increased their language skills and knowledge.
Through this system, you may obtain a document that accredits your knowledge from UPF Languages.
Procedure
Application : Self service language accreditation
Handbook
Quick guide
&nbsp;
Period
The entire academic year. It is important that you check the deadline for each process requiring accreditation.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Authority
Relevant vice-rectors.
&nbsp;
Requirements
You must be enrolled in an official programme at UPF.
&nbsp;
Important
It is compulsory to attach a language proficiency certificate. To search for and easily find the certificate you must attach, you may complete several fields in the search page. We recommend language and level. If the search returns too many certificates, you may indicate, if you know it, the institution or a word from the certificate in the corresponding section. [Leave Certificate ID blank]. ​
For the call for mobility applications, all you have to do is indicate your level and the date earned and attach the certificate.
If you want to apply for RAC credit recognition
and/or incorporate credits into the minor,
where applicable, you must tick the corresponding boxes.
To obtain the language proficiency document, the certificates you provide must be validated by the secretary’s office from your programme.
